            <p class="text-muted">My name is lakhiwe Liwani, I was born in Cape Town but originally from Eastern Cape in Butterworth. We are siblings of four, we stayed we our parents. I studied my primary and high school studies
              here in Cape Town and my interest in Information Technology started when I in high school when I was doing Computer Application Technology for 3years which I started it at grade 10 then my interest started then even though
              I had a first of studing Civil Engeneering after my Matric. After Matric, in 2012 I went to Northlink College to study Civil Engeneering but things did not go well with the campus I was in because of the things that were
              happening there, during the year there were lots of strikes because of the results were always delaying for the students. On 2013 I decided to study at CTi College in Claremont to study Information Technology but with financial problems at home
              I couldn't finish the studies there that year so on 2014 I studied IT A+ Certificate at Silulo Ulutho Technologies. In the middle of the year 2015 I heard about Codex from a friend of mine who studied there as well
              then I applied for the 2016 take-in but ran out of time to finish the 2 courses I was required to completed before February because I started late January but i manage to make it to the Bootcamp then that when I started at Codex in 2017
              which I was very happy because I waited for a long time to join Codex and to do the programming and see how wonderful to study the great languages as HTML, CSS and JS and frameworks like Node.js and its been a wonderful year to be Codex
              with wonderful mentors and a lot of support.<a>
